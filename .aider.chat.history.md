```
Build a simple language learning quiz , card flip, word fill in the sentence style app. Keep it responsive and colourful like duo lingo. Add a selection page for what language they want to learn , add flag emoji next to each language button. Have a whole level system for each language so that each language has multiple difficulty levels. If they get question right then respond with green and red if they get it wrong. Gamify it with 3 life’s, if wrong answer they lose life. When they compete all 5 questions per level they have confetti effect. Support multiple language that you have deep knowledge off. At end of level 5 for example, If learning content is finished then have a share button. It populates the share to Farcaster with populated post. Add whatever social networks allow prepopulated posts. Make sure to tag OpenxAI or OpenxAINetwork on the relevant social media post and platform. Make it fun and colourful !

The following files in your repository are the ones that will most likely need to be edited (or added) to implement the language‑learning quiz app you described:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – the main page that will host the language‑selection screen and the quiz UI.  
2. `mini-app/app/layout.tsx` – to wrap the new pages with the required layout and meta tags.  
3. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app’s title, description, and social‑media tags.  
4. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate a new colorful logo that matches the updated metadata.  

If you want to add new components or pages (e.g., a quiz component, a language‑selection page, etc.), you can create those files separately. Let me know which of the above files you’d like to add to the chat so I can provide the exact `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks.
